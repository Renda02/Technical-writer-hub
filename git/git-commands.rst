Essential Git command
=========

Git has more than 100 commands, but I use more or less the same amount of git commands regularly as a technical writer. This page outlines the git commands I use and some that may come in handy.

Before starting with any changes or updates, always run:

1. **Check the current status of your branch or repo**: This shows the state of your branch. 
``git status``

2. **Fetch all the latest from the team**: Ensure that your branch have the most up-to-date changes before making any changes.
``git pull``



Before you begin
--------

Make sure that Git is install in your local machine by running: ``git-version``

To configure Git,see `git <https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup/>`_ documentation.
